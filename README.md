# Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
 - In this project I tried to classify small images cifar10 dataset from tensorflow keras datasets. There are total 10 classes as shown below and we will use CNN for classification.

## Why Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) instead of the regular Artificial Neural Network(ANN)?
 - Regular neural networks struggle with images because of massive data and no built-in understanding of image structure. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are designed specifically 
   for images. They break down images into parts, share parameters efficiently, and automatically learn useful features, making them much better for image classification tasks.

## Libraries Used
 - Numpy
 - Seaborn
 - Tensorflow
 - Matplotlib

## Installation
 1. Prerequisites
    - Git
    - Command line familiarity
 2. Clone the Repository: git clone https://github.com/NebeyouMusie/Image-Classification-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Network.git
 3. Create and Activate Virtual Environment (Recommended)
    - python -m venv venv
    - source venv/bin/activate
 4. Install Libraries: pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib seaborn
 5. Open `cnn_cifar10.ipynb` and run all cells
 6. Or you can download the `cnn_cifar10.ipynb` Notebook from the repository, upload the notebook to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) then run all the cells in the `cnn_cifar10.ipynb` Notebook
